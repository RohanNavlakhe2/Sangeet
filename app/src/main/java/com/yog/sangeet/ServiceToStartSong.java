         foreground CPU scheduling (unless something else in that process is foreground)*/

        or creating background services unless the app itself is in the foreground. If an app
        needs to create a foreground service, the app should call startForegroundService().
        That method creates a background service, but the method signals to the system that
        the service will promote itself to the foreground. Once the service has been created,
        the service must call its startForeground() method within five seconds.*/
